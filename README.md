Using an API to build a random quote generator with Twitter integration.


#API
api will generate thosands of quotes. and then if you want to post that quote in twitter then you can do by just clicking on twitter butto.

#design
* hero pattern : setting a good background color/image/theme is a very important for any websites, so here comes hero pattern you can easily create backgroud theme as per your requirements.

*quote-checking : some times you will get a large quote that means it contains more thhan 120 words so for that i did a small changes in code. reduce the font size is simpler opption haha...
